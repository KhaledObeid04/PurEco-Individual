BINF 5900 Indvidual Assignment

I am Khaled Obeid, an early-entry masterâ€™s student in Bioinformatics and the Chief Executive Officer (CEO) of PurEco, our startup project focused on developing a revolutionary air purification system utilizing genetically engineered microbes.

As the CEO, I took on the responsibility of providing strategic leadership and ensuring that all team members were aligned with our shared vision. I organized regular team meetings, and set clear objectives. I acted as the central point of coordination, making sure that progress was being made efficiently and that any potential blockades were addressed.

In addition to keeping the team on track, I assisted across all areas including Research and Development, market analysis, and product design. I also led the customer discovery efforts to gather feedback.

My role demanded adaptability, time management, and a strong sense of accountability, and I remained committed to pushing the project forward while supporting my teammates throughout the development process.
